Project AndroidPlayroom
==================
The project aims to develop set of apps built with the latest Android tools, featuring an architecture consisting of simple,
reusable, and referencable components that can assist in the development of more useful apps.  
This approach also enables the quick setup of a hands-on app with minimal boilerplate code and setup.


Currently consists of the following apps:
1. [GithubPlayroom](https://github.com/shyamkp-11/AndroidPlayroom/tree/main/githubplayroom)
2. [The Geofence App](https://github.com/shyamkp-11/AndroidPlayroom/tree/main/geofenceplayroom)
3. [WithBluetooth App](https://github.com/shyamkp-11/AndroidPlayroom/tree/main/withbluetooth)

The project includes a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to setup build server for its app.

Most apps include individual Jenkinsfile which are currently used by Jenkins CI/CD to build and deploy dev-release app variants.
